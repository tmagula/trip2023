        <h2 class="my2Header" id="C1">Main information</h2>
        <p id="classicText">A bicycle wheel is a wheel, most commonly a wire wheel, designed for a bicycle. A pair is often called a wheelset,
        especially in the context of ready built "off the shelf" performance-oriented wheels.
        Bicycle wheels are typically designed to fit into the frame and fork via dropouts, and hold bicycle tires.</p>
        <h2 class="my2Header" id="C2">Inventition</h2>
        <p id="classicText">The first wheel to use the tension in metal spokes was invented by Sir George Cayley to achieve lightness in his 1853
        glider.</p>
        <h2 class="my2Header" id="C3">Hub</h2>
        <p id="classicText">A hub is the center part of a bicycle wheel. It consists of an axle, bearings and a hub shell. The hub shell typically
        has two machined metal flanges to which spokes can be attached. Hub shells can be one-piece with press-in cartridge or
        free bearings or, in the case of older designs, the flanges may be affixed to a separate hub shell.</p>
        <h3 class="my3Header">Axle</h3>
        <p id="classicText">The axle is attached to dropouts on the fork or the frame. The axle can attach using a:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;" id="classicText">
            <li>Quick release - a lever and skewer that pass through a hollow axle designed to allow for installation and removal of the
            wheel without any tools (found on most modern road bikes and some mountain bikes).</li><img src="Images/BallBearing.gif"
                style="float: right;">
            <li>Nut - the axle is threaded and protrudes past the sides of the fork/frame. (often found on track, fixed gear, single
            speed, BMX and inexpensive bikes)</li>
            <li>bolt - the axle has a hole with threads cut into it and a bolt can be screwed into those threads. (found on some single
            speed hubs, Cannondale Lefty hubs)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="my3Header">Bearings</h3>
        <p id="classicText">The bearings allow the hub shell (and the rest of the wheel parts) to rotate freely about the axle.
        Most bicycle hubs
        use steel or ceramic ball bearings. Some hubs use serviceable "cup and cone" bearings, whereas some use
        pre-assembled
        replaceable "cartridge" bearings.<br>
        A "cup and cone" hub contains loose balls that contact an adjustable 'cone' that is screwed onto the axle and a
        'race'
        that is pressed permanently into the hub shell. Both surfaces are smooth to allow the bearings to roll with little
        friction. This type of hub can be easily disassembled for lubrication, but it must be adjusted correctly; incorrect
        adjustment can lead to premature wear or failure.<br>
        In a "cartridge bearing" hub, the bearings are contained in a cartridge that is shaped like a hollow cylinder where
        the
        inner surface rotates with respect to the outer surface by the use of ball bearings. The manufacturing tolerances,
        as
        well as seal quality, can be significantly superior to loose ball bearings. The cartridge is pressed into the hub
        shell
        and the axle rests against the inner race of the cartridge. The cartridge bearing itself is generally not
        serviceable or
        adjustable; instead the entire cartridge bearing is replaced in case of wear or failure.</p>
        <h2 class="my2Header" id="C4">Rim</h2>
        <p id="classicText">
            <img src="Images/Bicycle_rim_diagrams_01.png"style="float: right;" width="187,5" height="225">
            The rim is commonly a metal extrusion that is butted into itself to form a hoop, though may also be a structure of
        carbon fiber composite, and was historically made of wood. Some wheels use both an aerodynamic carbon hoop bonded to an
        aluminum rim on which to mount conventional bicycle tires.
        
        Metallic bicycle rims are now normally made of aluminium alloy, although until the 1980s most bicycle rims - with the
        exception of those used on racing bicycles - were made of steel[9] and thermoplastic.
        
        Rims designed for use with rim brakes provide a smooth parallel braking surface, while rims meant for use with disc
        brakes or hub brakes sometimes lack this surface.
        
        The Westwood pattern rim was one of the first rim designs, and rod-actuated brakes, which press against the inside
        surface of the rim were designed for this rim. These rims cannot be used with caliper rim brakes.
        
        The cross-section of a rim can have a wide range of geometry, each optimized for particular performance goals.
        Aerodynamics, mass and inertia, stiffness, durability, tubeless tire compatibility, brake compatibility, and cost are
        all considerations. If the part of the cross-section of the rim is hollow where the spokes attached, as in the Sprint
        rim pictured, it is described as box-section or double-wall to distinguish it from single-wall rims such as the Westwood
        rim pictured.[10] The double wall can make the rim stiffer. Triple-wall rims have additional reinforcement inside the
        box-section.
        
        Aluminum rims are often reinforced with either single eyelets or double eyelets to distribute the stress of the spoke. A
        single eyelet reinforces the spoke hole much like a hollow rivet. A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both
        walls of a double-walled rim.
        
        Clincher rims
        
        Fitting rim tape around 26 inch wheel (MTB). Rim tape protects the bicycle wheel’s inner tube from spoke holes, which
        will puncture the tube if exposed inside the rim.
        Most bicycle rims are "clincher" rims for use with clincher tires. These tires have a wire or aramid (Kevlar or Twaron)
        fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire
        carcass and maintains the bead lock. If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has spoke holes, they must
        be covered by a rim tape or strip, usually rubber, cloth, or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.
        
        An advantage of this system is that the inner tube can be easily accessed in the case of a leak to be patched or
        replaced.
     
        The ISO 5775-2 standard defines designations for bicycle rims. It distinguishes between
        
        Straight-side (SS) rims
        Crochet-type (C) rims
        Hooked-bead (HB) rims
        Traditional clincher rims were straight-sided. Various "hook" (also called "crochet") designs emerged in the 1970s to
        hold the bead of the tire in place,[11][12] allowing high (6–10 bar, 80–150 psi) air pressure.
        Tubular or sew-up rims

        Main article: Tubular tire
        Some rims are designed for tubular tires which are torus shaped and attached to the rim with adhesive. The rim provides
        a shallow circular outer cross section in which the tire lies instead of flanges on which tire beads seat.

        Tubeless
        A tubeless tire system requires an airtight rim — capable of being sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they go all
        the way through the rim) and the tire bead seat — and a compatible tire. Universal System Tubeless (UST), originally
        developed by Mavic, Michelin and Hutchinson[13] for mountain bikes is the most common system of tubeless tires/rims for
        bicycles.[14]
        <img src="Images/Bicycle_rim_diagrams_03.png"
            style="float: right;" width="187,5" height="225">
        The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without
        getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.[13]

        Some cyclists have avoided the price premium for a tubeless system by sealing the spoke holes with a special rim strip
        and then sealing the valve stem and bead seat with a latex sealer.[13] However, tires not designed for tubeless
        application do not have as robust a sidewall as those that are.[13]
        
        The drawbacks to tubeless tires are that they are notorious for being harder to mount on the rim than clincher
        tires,[13] and that the cyclist must still carry a spare tube to insert in case of a flat tire due to a puncture.[13]
        
        French tire manufacturer Hutchinson has introduced a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities
        to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims,
        like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road Tubeless rim is
        similar to the hook bead of a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road
        Tubeless tire, creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner
        tube.
        
        Increasingly common are tubeless tires conforming to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) standard pioneered by French
        wheel manufacturer Mavic in conjunction with tire manufacturers Hutchinson and Michelin.
        
        In 2006, Shimano and Hutchinson introduced a tubeless system for road bikes</p>

        <h2 class="my2Header" id="C5">Spokes</h2>
        <p id="classicText">The rim is connected to the hub by several spokes under tension. Original bicycle wheels used wooden spokes that could
        be loaded only in compression, modern bicycle wheels almost exclusively use spokes that can only be loaded in tension.
        There are a few companies making wheels with spokes that are used in both compression and tension.[16]
        
        One end of each spoke is threaded for a specialized nut, called a nipple, which is used to connect the spoke to the rim
        and adjust the tension in the spoke. This is normally at the rim end. The hub end normally has a 90 degree bend to pass
        through the spoke hole in the hub, and a head so it does not slip through the hole.
        
        Double-butted spokes have reduced thickness over the center section and are lighter, more elastic, and more aerodynamic
        than spokes of uniform thickness. Single-butted spokes are thicker at the hub and then taper to a thinner section all
        the way to the threads at the rim.[17] Triple-butted spokes also exist and are thickest at the hub, thinner at the
        threaded end, and thinnest in the middle.[18]
        
        Apart from tubeless wheels, which do not need them, tubed bicycle wheels require rim tapes or strips, a flexible but
        tough liner strip (usually rubber or woven nylon or similar material) attached to the inner circumference of the wheel
        to cover the ends of the nipples. Otherwise, the nipple ends wear a hole in the tube causing a flat tire.
        
        In 2007, Mavic introduced their R-Sys, a new bicycle spoke technology that allows the spokes to be loaded in both
        tension and compression. This technology is promised to allow for fewer spokes, lower wheel weight and inertia,
        increased wheel stiffness, with no loss of durability. However, in 2009 Mavic recalled R-Sys front wheels due to spoke
        failures leading to collapse of the entire wheel.[19]</p>
